Css Selectors

A selector determines which elements a CSS rule applies to. 
Several ways an element can be targeted with a selector.
Selectors can target multiple elements on the page. Single CSS rule can apply multiple elemnts.
Element or class selector can select multiple elements that have that class or element name.

An element will have the properties from all applicable CSS rules applied to it.

Basic selector types

-Universal
* matches all elements. 
specified as single selector, to select all elements in the doc, or with combinators

* {
  margin: 0;
}

-Element
tag name
targets an HTML element by its tag name. syntax of the selector is the name of the element.
this will apply a margin to all div elements

p {
  margin: 25px;
}

-ID
# followed by the id value 
HTML elements can have an id attribute. only one element with a given id. 
multiple elements with the same id should be avoided.
the element with an id attribute whose value is header will recieve 25px of padding.
If you need to apply a stlye to more than one element, you can use class selectors inead of ID selectors.

#header {
  padding: 25px;
}

-Class
.followed by the name of the class
HTML element can have a class attribute.
class used to mark all elements of a related type
Any numbr of HTML elements can have the same class attribute. 
AND a single HTML element can have any number of classes applied to it. 
seperated by space in the value of the class attribute

.nav-link {
  color: darkcyan;
}

Class selector will match every element in the doc with the given class. 

-Attribute
[]
several forms
[name] selects all elements that have the given attribute, regardless of value

[name="value"] selects all elements that have the given attribute, whose value is the string "value"
