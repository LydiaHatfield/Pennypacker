CSS Basics

Summary:
The syntax and structure of CSS rules

How conflicts are handled

The three ways to use CSS in an HTML document – inline styles, style blocks, and external style sheets


CSS preprocessors

The critical rendering path – the DOM, CSSOM, and render tree

CSS a language for specifying how an HTML document is displayed. 
"cascading" refers to the heirarchy of multiple overlapping selectors. 
In the event of a conflict the most specific selector wins. 

1996 W3C published the CSS standard, a powerful tool for styling HTML docs

Style sheet consists of rules.
Rules target HTML elements using selectors that descrie the elements to which the styles sould e applies.

Rule Syntax

A rule consists of a selector followed by a block of CSS properties contained inside curly braces. 

The properties consist of a property and value separated by a colon and are delimited with semicolons. 

A value may be a single value or a collection of multiple values, depending on the property.

Every element in the document that is matched by the selector has the properties in the CSS rule applied to it.

.header {
  background-color: red;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  }
  
This rule targets any element with the class header.

Property Conflicts 

If the same property is used more than once in a given rule the last definition in the rule wins.

CSS chooses the most specific selector and the most recent (last) property in a rule.

/*Comments*/

At-Rule
@ is a special CSS rule that acts as a directive controlling the behavior of CSS.
Things like @charset (defines the character encoding used) or @import (imports contents of another style sheet)

In-line
Inline styles are specified as CSS properties in the value of the style attribute.
no selectors or curly braces, only css properties
applies to a single element and always takes precedence
<div style="background-color: red;">
  Hello world!
</div>

Style Block
Rules specified inside a style sheet within the HTML doc by adding CSS rules inside a style element.
Added to the document's head element
Full style sheet with selectors and rules
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      div {
        background-color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>Hello world!</div>
  </body>
</html>

External Style Sheets

Rules listed in a style sheet file with a .css extention.
Style sheet is then referenced in the head of the HTML document using a link element

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/file.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>Hello world!</div>
  </body>
</html>

Example of simple external CSS file
div {
  background-color: red;
}

Browser Support
More recent browser versions tend to use experimental feature flags rather than vendor prefixes. 
These are special configuration flags that are exposed in an advanced configuration interface where experimental features can be turned on and off.

Web Resources

caniuse.com (for finding browser support for a given feature)
Mozilla Developer Network (exhaustive reference to all CSS properties)

CSS Preprocessors
Sass, LESS, Stylus
Takes your style sheet and converts them to plain CSS, ready to use in the browser
Supports Nested rules, variables and mixins, which CSS does not.

The Document Object Model (DOM)

Data structure in the browser. 
Tree of DOM nodules created by reading and parsing the HTML elements in the document and their structure and hierarchy.

CSS Object Model (CSSOM)
tree structure that represents the hierarchy of styles in the document
The browser parses the CSS (which blocks the rendering of the page) and creates the CSSOM

The Render Tree
DOM and CSSOM are combined to form the render tree

Layout and Paint
This stage of the process looks at styles such as width, height, position, margin, and padding, to determine each element's size and location on the page. 
nothing is actually shown on screen yet.
Once layout is complete, the browser can begin painting by applying styles such as color and font to determine the actual pixels to draw on the screen.
